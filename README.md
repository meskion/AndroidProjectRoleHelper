# AndroidProjectRoleHelper

Project done for my Multimedia Programming class.

Mobile app where you can create, view and modify character templates for a roleplaying game. The templates are stored remotely persist when you close the application.

There is some interactivity with the templates. if you click on any attribute the app will roll a dice for you. Also you can increment some basic numbers that may change in a game session like the Health Points.
